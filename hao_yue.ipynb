    "    This project requires the following packages:\n",
    "    - pandas, numpy, seaborn, folium ,matplotlib 3.1.0 \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To make sure that all the graphs will be created successfully, user should check whether these packages have been installed or not. If not, these seaborn and folium packages should be downloaded and installed in advance. There are several ways to do it.In conda prompt, using commend: ***conda create -f environment.yml*** to create a new conda environment. If it fails, using the commend: ***conda install seaborn*** and ***conda install -c conda-forge folium*** to install two packages. Or, in the terminal, using commend: ***pip install seaborn*** and ***pip install folium***. To make sure that the graph will be displayed in a full version, matolptlib version should be 3.1.0.\n",
    "    To run this project, make sure the above packages are installed, and then simply clone the repo at http://www.github.com/YueHao96/inf510_project and execute this notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If you want to run the python files, there are two offered parameters.\n",
    "    In terminal, run the commend: ***python main.py relation***, after few minutes, four graphs will be created and saved under the current path. However, these four graphs will not present together. After running the code, one graph show in a pop up window After closing the current window, the next graph will show up. The first graph is a correlation matrix, and the next three graphs are scatter diagrams in four dimensions.\n",
    "    If commend: ***python main.py distribution*** is used, one map will be presented on the browser and to .html files will be saved under the current path. This map show the distribution of 50 house locations with highest housing values and 50 house locations with lowest housing values in Los Angeles County. On the webpage, this map is interactive. It means that viewer can zoom in or out the map to explore the location of each house.Also, if click on the icon, specific hosing value will pop up."

    "    \n",
    "   - Firstly, collected data are not adequate enough. Data collection and organization are based on zip codes. Zip codes in Los Angeles County ranges from 90001 to 93599. If available, more than 3000 records for each data set are expected. However, based on zip code and city name, Zillow API is constructed but clean data obtained from requests are only around 250 records. Compared with 3000 expected results, the data volume is not satisfying. It may be explained by the restriction of the website. However, there may be better resources for data collection.\n",
    "   - Secondly, if city boundaries are drown on the distribution map, it may be easier to view and analysis spatial patterns in city level. Also, two labeled city names are overlapped by the color bar but I do not know how to adjust it.  \n",
    "   - Thirdly, as I have mentioned in second question, the matplotlib version should be 3.1.0. If the current version of matplotlib is 3.1.1, the correlation matrix will be drawn but the image is not complete. This is a problem that is out of scope to solve."

    "    - Firstly, there is a strong positive correlation between household median income and housing value.It is somehow confirmed with the assumption in milestone1 that in areas where housing values are high, the household median income level is also high.\n",
    "    - Secondly, most houses with high values are grouped at southwestern part of LA county and a large part of them are located along the coastline while houses with low values are clustered at southestern part except few houses located at the north.\n",
    "    - Thirdly, there is no clear pattern between walk score and housing value.Because the correlation coefficient between walk score and housing value is 0.13 which is too small to be counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Except for the supposed ones in Milestone1, there are more outcomes. \n",
    "    - On one hand, there are strong correlations between household median income level and other factors: housing values, population density and violent crime rate. In areas where household median income is less than 60,000 USD , and the housing value is less than 1000,000 USD, population density is very high and violent crime rate is usually grater than 50%.For reference, the US average is 22.7%.Generally speaking, with the increase of income level and housing value, violent crime rate is decreasing but this phenomenon can not be applied to population density. \n",
    "    - On the other hand, though less significant, correlations between population density, walk score, violent crime rate and income level are also worth analyzing. In areas where population density are high, walk scores and violent crime rates are also high and vise versa.However,income level is higher in areas where population density is low."

Zillow API is then used.However, response from the data request is not neat and different from the format that we usually see. It takes me some time to figure out how to make a wise loop to find needed data as well as reduce repeat of code. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Also, since there are five factors involved, presenting these five variables in one graph is somehow impractical. I have tried several methods like a 3D scatter diagram but the final result is very messy. To avoid a messy situation, I decide to check the relevancy between different factors and then analyze the most relevant ones."

To be more specific, this portal is used for users to search housing value and violent crime rate based on zip code or community name. Also, based on user’s income level, the system will return the information about his or her affordable houses. Skills like how to build a client server in Pyhon3 is needed.\n",

Also, when talking about site-choosing, more environmental factors are also of high relevance like are there any hospitals, schools, parks or food outlets around. In addition, algorithm can be applied to calculate different factors int one index to suggest the living environment condition."
